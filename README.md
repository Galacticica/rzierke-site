## Marvel Connections
A website that shows all the connections between Marvel Characters (and maybe other fandoms in the future) 
Each character is connected to:
- projects they are in
- allies
- enemies
- familial connections (arrows for direction)

The goal is to have each character shown but also to be able to select one character and see only their direct connections, and to be able to select 2 characters and see all paths that they are connected by.
