## Marvel Connections
A website that shows all the connections between Marvel Characters (and maybe other fandoms in the future) 
Each character is connected to:
- projects they are in
- allies
- enemies
- familial connections (arrows for children?)

- variants

The goal is to have each character shown but also to be able to select one character and see only their direct connections, and to be able to select 2 characters and see all paths that they are connected by.
